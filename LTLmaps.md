What project are you building

Privacy-first location-based app to publish photos, tags, and notes about the places you love. We change the user experience by surfacing content on your timeline, based on your current location, places recommended by friends, and tag-based filters. Simply call to make a reservation, get directions, or catch up with real-life friends to plan your next trip. Bringing the social back to social media. A tool for shared experiences.

Why did you decide to build it

If you have found something unique or your trip was so unforgettable, you can easily share it with your friends on social media, but what happens when, many months later,  they actually end up visiting that place, will they remember that incredible restaurant you posted on Instagram, and if they do, will they know where to find it?  

How long will it take
6 months

How much funding are you requesting
$50K

Proposal Project 

If anything good comes from this post C19 era, it's that people want to connect with real-life friends and explore the places that are nearby as much as they want to discover the rest of the world.FeaturesFigma designs are now converted into React Native. Our (ex-Samsung) dev started to develop the backend with MongoDB startup support. We started with the design for the Apple Watch App.Five-star systems are good at identifying and weeding out very low-quality places, they do a poor job of separating good from great. We want to get trustworthy recommendations from our friends and add these places to our own map.

Team description

In the past 10 years, I curated surf accommodation & real estate. We created a community of nearly 100.000 followers. The brand had exposure to 100 million eyeballs. Now, building a privacy-first location-based app to share magic places with friends. Read our thoughts, stories, and ideas @ www.livethelife.tv 

Katrien has proven her strengths in customer service, administration, and project management. She established know-how about all aspects of building the brand, creating partnerships with hospitality brands, entrepreneurs, and visual storytellers. She learned to pick the right tools to operate with excellence and efficiency.

Timeline, Milestones, and Deliverables

We are a fully remote team of 8 people spread across 4 countries. We now invite storytellers to join us to expand our collection of places to sleep, eat, and play. It is quite hard to find on-the-ground experts in all the regions our app would want to cover. We will be constantly growing and nurturing our freelancer hub.

We have a huge passion for design, code, and travel content. We can not stop curating hotspots and developing a platform to share those experiences. It’s what we love the most and it’s what we do best.
